# Open Source Society Zimbabwe

The Open Source Society is a community-driven initiative dedicated to strengthening and expanding the open-source ecosystem in Zimbabwe and across Africa. Our mission is to empower developers, creators, and learners to build solutions that reflect African contexts and contribute meaningfully to the global open-source movement.

## What We Offer

As a community-first organization, we focus on three core pillars:

- **Community Projects** – Collaborative software built to solve local and African challenges

- **Software Solutions** – Open-source tools designed with African contexts in mind

- **Mentorship & Growth** – Guiding and supporting contributors at every level

- Curated beginner-friendly projects with clear setup instructions

- Selected "good first issues" for skill building

- Step-by-step contribution guides for each language

- Mentorship, peer support, and collaborative learning

- Multiple contribution paths: code, documentation, testing, design, and more

- Skill-based project filtering to help contributors find a good fit

- Project health indicators such as activity, response times, and community engagement

## Languages

We currently highlight projects in:

- [JavaScript, TypeScript](https://github.com/oss-zw/javascript-typescript-projects)
- [Dart, Flutter](https://github.com/oss-zw/dart-flutter-projects)
- [Python](https://github.com/oss-zw/python-projects)
- [Kotlin](https://github.com/oss-zw/kotlin-projects)

More languages and African community-built projects will be added as we grow.

## How It Works

1. Explore curated project lists by language
2. Filter by skill level and contribution type
3. Connect with maintainers and community members
4. Contribute to real-world projects and build your open-source portfolio
